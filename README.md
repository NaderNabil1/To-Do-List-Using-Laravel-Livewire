First of all thanks for giving me this opportunity , I must say i have learnt a lot in this project ..

Steps for set up the project

1-Clone the project from here https://github.com/NaderNabil1/To-Do-List-Using-Laravel-Livewire
2-Migrate the database "php artisan migrate"
3-open the local host "php artisan serve"

Packages used in this project 

1-Livewire
2-Breeze

-I used breeze-livewire interface for my project
-All the features mention in PDF file are there in the project


IMPORTANT NOTE: 

*It's my first Livewire project ever so maybe it's not clear code enough but i will work on this in upcoming projects *
*I'm worst one to choose colors*
